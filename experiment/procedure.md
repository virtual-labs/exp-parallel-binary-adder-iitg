1. Choose the IC to use in the experiment – place the component on the breadboard.
	                
2. Connect the inputs of the IC to the logic sources (A, B) and its output to the logic 	indicators (S, C) –  make the wire connections between the various components.
	                
3. Apply various input combinations and observe output for each one – use the DIP switches 	to apply various input combinations and note the LED indicators.
	                
4. Verify the truth table for each input/output combination.
	                
5. Exit the experiment when done – use the “Close” button to exit.
